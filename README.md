Hey there! 👋 I'm Heitor, a passionate software engineer with a diverse background in various technologies and domains. With over a decade of experience, I've had the opportunity to work with a wide range of stacks, programming languages, and tools.

In the last 4 years, my focus has been on improving observability, SRE, DevOps, and cloud-native technologies. I'm passionate about building robust, scalable, and maintainable systems that deliver value to users.

Additionally, I'm proud to be an [AWS Solutions Architect Professional](https://www.credly.com/badges/669d4870-21f6-46c6-b79c-348d9baa28dc) certified, demonstrating my expertise in designing and deploying scalable, highly available, and fault-tolerant distributed systems on AWS.

If you're looking for a seasoned software engineer to join your team, I'd be more than happy to chat and explore how I can contribute to your project. 🤝 Feel free to reach out, and let's connect!
